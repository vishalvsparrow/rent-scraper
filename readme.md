## What is this?

Just a silly scraper written in Python to make API calls to a public endpoint that I discovered on an apartment leasing website. The data is then loaded into BigQuery tables. I have removed my credentials and project information, so you will need to supply your own.

## What can I do with it?

Modify it, and scrape your own URLs, Deploy on Heroku if you must and schedule it on a One-Off Dyno
